Title: Specialty Labs

Summary: Describes specialized labs such as the 405 sysadmin lab and the 3rd floor network labs. Probably a little on the mac lab if 

Background:
-student sysadmins
-student net admins
-issues with upper campus

How to (Sysadmin lab):
-core servers (cheetah, jaguar)
  -nis
  -dns
  -dhcp
-master image (similar to main labs)
-Cloning (also similar to main labs)

How to (Net Admin labs):
-Cannot be isolated, so restricted.

Optional:
-telnet only labs to special core servers (how ada compiles worked)
-Virtual machine labs (machines running a VM on top that can be snapshot)

Issues:
-Isolation complication
  -can't update via repository. Need the whole distro on disk or temporarily open the lab up.
-Account issues.
-Sharing the lab (when 476 and 472 were at once, needed a quick clone method)
