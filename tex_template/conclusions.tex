\section{Crossover Bias is Significant}
Combinatorial crossover bias is a significant issue with binary strings.  Crossover that of the form $0..2^n -1$, which includes all normal integer type variables that are some whole number of bytes.

\section{Offset Improvement Significant but Insufficient}
Simple linear offsets make significant but insufficient improvement to the Pearson's $\chi^2$ test for uniformity, almost all would not.
