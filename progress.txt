Todo:
-formatting to tex or failing that, to M$ word (I would be ashamed...)
-Table of contents: has to wait until after the master outline done.
-The appendix with all the hard instructions and scripts.

Progress of sections:
-unclogging: Ready for review.
-documentation solution: Ready for review.
-ssh push: Ready for review.
-Student faculty help: nearly finished, need section on barefoot specifics.
-filesystem management: in progress.
-Lab printing: just started. 
-printservers: just added. Necessary to finish the thoughts on lab printing.

Progress of Outlines:
-More or less finished (will obviously mod or change up as needed)
-Still need install_master outline but that must be done last since its sections depend on the others. 

Progress of Research:
-Still need to look up notes on local_repository even if not doing.
