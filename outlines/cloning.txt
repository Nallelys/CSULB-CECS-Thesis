Title: Cloning

Summary: Setting up the nfs/dhcpd/tftpboot server and cloning instructions.

Note: making the master image is in another section. This section assumes the image is available on another server (tiger) first. 

How to (printserver):
-Explain and Setup dhcpd server
-Explain and Setup tftpboot server (look up how to mod the bootloader)
-Explain and Setup nfs server
-Copy the image to each lab server (explain why you need a server per lab per subnet)

How to (Lab Load):
-BIOS setup
-network boot to slackware (or another distro)
-install script and what it does. 
-OPTIONAL: fully automated lab installs with wakeonlan and timing script. Advantages and why it isn't necessary in our case (but would be nice).

Efficiency:
-Description of how long it takes, how efficient it is, and how it compares to other lab install methods (kickstart, jumpstart, etc). This is basically a comparison between what CECS does vs what I do at IBM.
