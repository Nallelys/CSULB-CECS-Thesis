Title: Unclogging the lab machines. 

Summary: What the students may leave behind and how to clear it. Also, how to prevent students from rendering machines inoperable.

How to:
-Limit amount of space students can write to. (/tmp and /var/tmp for example)
-limit number of processes spawned. 
-killing zombie processes, unfudging the terminal, using a cleanup script, etc.
-rebooting (the easiest solution)
