Title: Main Lab Images

Note: This will be a fairly large section. Detail stuff from install_master.

Overview on what should be in there (do last)

How to (some may be references to other sections):
-Booting from cd and doing barebones install.
-Setting up root or admin (dummy workaround).
-setting up networking.
-Master package (repository) list and installation. Then removal of uneeded (cups), and autoremove.
-Manual package (source or binaries) installation.(drjava,derby)
-Text only login (init 3 or removing gdm.con)
-REF:Automount (may be a reference to filesystem management)
-Groups
-REF: Mail
-Disable student control (ctrl-alt-del, menu shutdown, yp tools, )
-Powersaving
-system logs and optionally log forwarding for audit purposes.
-REF: ssh host and authorized keys
-REF: Printing (should also include paper compiled commands)
-REF: support commands local
-Restrict access (hosts.allow,deny,cron.deny,expired shells should go here as well). Note the alternative, iptables for firewalling the outside. Also note that ideally you'd want to be behind a master firewall (corporate)
-ntp (time)
-Bootloader setup (lilo.conf). Also note the linked kernel.
-REF: rebooting to cleanup. (and include crontab)
-Login scripts (set hostname, check space, alter environment, etc)
-motd
-Miscellaneus tweaks (firefox,pine/alpine(describe general because this happens often),gtk printing,eclipse printing,jetty,ctrl-alt-bksp,pmount,pumount) 
-Considerations for different hardware architectures (64 bit compiles,manual
driver install)
