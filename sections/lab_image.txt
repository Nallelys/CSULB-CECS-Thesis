The most time consuming part of managing a lab is building and maintaining the master images to the labs. All workstations in the lab are basically clones of a single machine designated as the lab master. This machine is then cloned using the cloning process. Details on cloning can be found in the cloning section. 


At some point, a CD or DVD must be used to run the installer for the image. This may not be a physical disk if the image is netbooted, but for CECS labs, the chosen distribution Ubuntu will not support a netboot to CD.
