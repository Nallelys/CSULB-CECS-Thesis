General labs are not always sufficient for all applications. Sometimes, specialty labs are necessary to do functions that general labs cannot do. These labs will often have special requirements, such as unique equipment, a different network configuration, a different accounting system, and often a different room environment. The labs we've covered consist of: a system administration lab, a network administration lab, a computing cluster lab, a dedicated security lab, a terminal lab, a virtualized lab, and an individual projects lab.
