Up until now, only Linux based labs have been described. However, to be competitive in today's market, many platforms need to be considered. In CECS, we have a combination of Windows, Mac OSX, and various distributions of Linux.  Getting all of them to play nicely with each can often be an aggravating (sometimes maddening) process. In addition, the system administrators rarely have a choice of which platform to use.  

-3 common user account systems: LDAP, M$ AD (based on LDAP), and NIS/NIS+
The most important thing to consider in a mixed platform environment is the user accounting system. This is the system that manages login user IDs, user attributes, and passwords. User attributes may consist of a user's full name, student/employee name, contact email, etc. Some other useful attributes could be a list of courses that student takes or his major. For employees, 

At the very least, the system needs to manage user IDs and passwords centrally. If this is not done, each platform must have its own central authentication system set up and each user must remember separate sets of user IDs and passwords (though the users 


-Software
Even though a platform may not always work nicely with another platform, a lot of software has been ported to work across different platforms. This is nice because certain labs can then be scheduled for use with multiple courses in a curriculum. For example, Adobe's Web Development Suite has been ported to both Windows and Macintosh platforms. So either lab can be scheduled for Web Development courses. Eclipse and other Java based applications work on all platforms that a Java interpreter has been ported to. This allows some flexibility in lab schedules so that courses that need platform specific software can get it more easily. In addition, a lab may be able to remotely access servers of another platform. For example, the Linux labs can be scheduled to use a Windows specific piece of software because students can use the rdesktop command to remotely use a Windows Terminal Server. 

-Issues
Issues with multiple platforms are many and varied.
