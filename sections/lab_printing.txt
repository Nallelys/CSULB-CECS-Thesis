Although digital copies of work are becoming more common, physical prints are still a practical necessity in labs, especially for education. Instructors still collect paper copies and write feedback on them. With the advent of tablet computing this is becoming less and less necessary but is still a requirement as of this writing. 

Printing in labs is relatively straightforward to set up. The simplest way to set up printing is to put the printer on a network and configure it as such. With a network printer, this setup is made even easier by plugging the printer directly into the network and giving it a static IP. This works in situations where paper quotas are not needed such as with faculty offices. This assumes the faculty don't abuse the print privilege. 

In a student environment, however, it is usually not a good idea to assume students won't abuse the system. In the case of CECS labs, we noticed that implementing a paper quota where student have to pay a small amount per paper ream caused the amount of printing to go down to reasonable levels. As far as printing costs though, ink will almost always be the most expensive portion of print costs. 

That being said, a limited paper system is somewhat more complex to setup. Most printers, even with network capability, won't have the features necessary. Instead, the printer must be plugged into a print server that can manage print queues and a paper crediting system. The server may have other functionality (which is described in another section) but one of its main functions will supply the labs with printing.
